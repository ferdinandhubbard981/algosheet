independant set definition

wk1:
big o:
slide 4 of big o slides with notation descriptions

week 2:
interval scheduling:
interval scheduling algorithms and complexity etc...
interval scheduling algorithms proofs

graph theory:
all definitions of graph properties with examples if necessary
{Graph, edge, verted, component, degree, walk, isomorphism, euler walk, connected, 
digraph, strongly connected, weakly connected, in-degree, out-degree, 
cycle, hamilton cycle, }


all graph notation:
component is x subset G
component is also a graph
strong component definition (not same as strongly connected)
G{a, b ,c} is a graph
{a, b, c} is a set of vertices

proof that all walks from u to v contain path from u to v
week 3:
digraph:
N+() and N-() notation
d+() and d-()
euler walk and weakly/ stronly connected properties and proof
strongly connected includes isolated vertex
5F and 5h proof
euler walk undirected graph d+ = d- except for start and end

5f proof

Dirac's theorem, definition, proof (3 lemmas)

handshaking lemma  definition and proof
k-regular graph definition
directed handshaking lemma definition and proof

trees:

definitions {forest, tree, degree of a TREE}
definitions and proofs:
{lemma 1, lemma 2, lemma 3}
Equivalence/ implication proofs for:
{
    A: T is connected and has no cycles: ie a tree
    B: T has n-1 edges and is connected
    C: T has n-1 edges and no cycles
    D: T has a unique path beween any pair of vertices
} 
A => B, C, D
B, C, D => A

claim on slide 12 of trees proof and definition
